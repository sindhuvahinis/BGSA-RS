# BGSA-RS
A feature selection algorithm with Binary Gravitational Search Algorithm and Rough Set Theory

This combinational feature-selection algorithm was proposed by me and my team in my undergrad final year project. 

This algorihtm was tried on Trust Measure Paramters dataset. 

In this work, a novel TMP selection algorithm based on Rough Set Theory (RST) and Binary Gravitational Search Algorithm (BGSA) has been designed to select the prominent TMPs with respect to the cloud service type and userâ€™s requirements. On the trust assessment framework, the selected TMPs are made available to the users as a suggestion, based on the cloud service type
opted by the user.

The implementation of this algorithm and dataset is provided in this repository.
